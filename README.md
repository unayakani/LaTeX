# LaTeX
My LaTeX project structure and workflow.
Have a look at [compiled pdf](main.pdf)

## Software I use
* [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org): for diagrams
* [Neovim](https://neovim.io): for text editing
    * Neovim plugins used:
        * [Vimtex](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex): for compiling raw LaTeX
* [Evince](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/evince/) and [Zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/): for PDF viewing
* and obviously, [LaTeX](https://latex-project.org)
